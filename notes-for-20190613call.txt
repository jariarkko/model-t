- Logistics:
    - Dramatis Personae: Jari, Brian, Stephen, Ted 
    - time: 20190613 1800 CEST
    - url: https://meet.google.com/ogt-byti-jki?hs=122

SF notes of call are at the bottom...

- possible agenda for the call:
    - quickly skim (in 5 min) the points below to see if going through
      things in this order is sensible (or haggle over that via 
      email ahead of time) 
    - if so, do so (editing as we go in some etherpad or similar)
    - if not, do what?
    - AOB:-)

- main drafts/inputs (take the references from these as stated):
    - BCP72/RFC3552
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-farrell-etm
    - https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-arkko-arch-internet-threat-model
    - what else (not referenced from any of the above)?
    - anything deserve to be promoted from referred-to by one of 
      the above?
    - anything else from DEDR?

- a couple of principles/starting points (to see if we agree with 'em):
    - This bit of BCP72/RFC3552 remains correct: "we assume that the
      attacker has nearly complete control of the communications
      channel"
    - The bit that's changed is that the endpoints aren't as trusted as
      was the case in 2003
    - Another bit that's changed is that assume there are attackers actively
      cross-correlating flows across many different channels  

- possible short-term process (may be better at end of call):
    - develop this work via a set of (weekly?) concalls over the next
      ~month with this set of folks (anyone else sorely needed right
      now?)
    - document results for IAB consumption however seems best
      (presentation, I-D, whatever) and present to IAB Sunday of
      @IETF105 (could be joint topic with IESG maybe, or just invite in
      Sec ADs)
    - propse continuing the work in a (re-populated?) secpriv programme
      or close secpriv and start a new programme (with most work done
      on open list) 
        - would need to chat with MT, and secpriv list about that first
          of course
    - consider a side-meeting @IETF105? (not sure) 

- possible new protocol design recommendatons to explore (as potential
  additions to BCP72, should something end up garnering IETF consensus):
    - consider protocol abuse-cases as well as use-cases
    - consider that all configuration could be on a VM with an
      adversarial dom0 or equivalent
    - consider that all stored data will leak if we just wait long
      enough
    - consider that all hosts will be compromised if we just wait long
      enough
    - consider the number of interactions in which endpoints engage and
      the (overwhelming) probability that endpoints end up interacting
      with compromised peers

- examples of possible protocol design changes resulting from
  considerations above (in same order, not all examples of success
  outcomes;-):
    - remove or avoid a new tracking capability; QUIC connection ID
    - post key compromise requirements in MLS
    - use emphemeral identifiers that aren't easily correlated over
      different sessions even if typical session logging is done (HTTP
      cookies -> not cookies)
    - ensure enrollment can be re-done after factory-reset (ACME)
    - provide ways to report on summaries/statistics (TLS-RPT) 
    

- Two good points not easy to whack into the above from Ted:

    - An additional complication to your trust point is that many services and
      a number of applications aren't resident in a single network node any
      more.  For IoT devices, the application might be resident in the
      Sensor/Hub/Cloud, and the communications among them have some odd boundaries as
      a result (the trust boundary looks more like IPC than end-to-end
      communication).  For services, CDNs, load balancers, and service function
      chaining have all pretty much exploded the "website on a server" view of the
      world.  You add that to your "all endpoints will be compromised eventually"
      point and it gets worse.

    - Oh, and don't get me started about the effort to keep containers and VMs
      in ignorance of their actual topology and relationship to host systems.

Notes:
- group: start small, hold pen, then try drag others in
- BT/TH: better assume attacker controls comms environment (not just
	channel,endpoint)
- TH: we may be assuming something is h/w but it's s/w on some bad host
- JA: DEDR, some validation that work here needed there; we *are* all crazy:-)
	- some things need to be framed in an architectural fashion, e.g.
	Andrew argued about e2e principle; such a framing would be useful;
	e.g. real-end ideas in Jari's draft
- TH: does anyone show you when someone else is in control of the buffer in
  a (set of) flows, e.g. kernel mgr <here>, router <there>... e.g. if
  NFV or SFC used, about 4 people control the buffer for each in/out
- SF: web visualations of things with which you interact exist, not sure 
  about lower layer 
- JA: not just a router, other places see cleartext
- TH: routers see/can-infer meta-data
- JA: we have work on stuff like that e.g. ESNI
- BT: getting there for web, but elsewhere tuples are still v. useful
	or else BGP hijacking wouldn't be so attractive
- JA: we still need comsec improvements, and more
- BT: encryption of data at rest - we may have existing IETF statements on
  that...
- JA: in .is, we wanted to document the case of closed networks that are
  not - a possible I-D (SF forgot that entirely, it's a good thing though)
- BT: Some of the list of design recs aren't IETF stuff, but for other folks
- BT: maybe these interdependencies lead to things that are too complex,
  but that can lead to more consolidation
- JA: missing data minimisation from design rec list
- TH: not just server minimisation, also client oughtn't ask for so much
  'cause that'll also leak, maybe FF trying to do this kind of thing, not
  asking for a pixel tracker unless there's something that needs that
  URL de-ref'd; good result might be some tracking doesn't occur due
  to such lazy evaluation in browser
- JA: web != client-server, but also ad networks etc.
- JA: recent FF privacy enhancements as an example, not sure about QUIC
  connection ID
- TH: QUIC conn id - each side has indpendent value it uses with other,
  rather than one side picking, so can lead to even large structured IDs
  that are good for load balancing can't easily be used to track
- JA: QUIC provides good design patterns for COMSEC, but we're trying to
  go beyond now, so...
- TH: QUIC conn id design pattern also considers internal paths in ways 
  that try not expose state that oughtn't be visible to n/w path so maybe
  does go beyond COMSEC
- possible "thanks" message for privsec: thanks, looks like we're done
  in our present form, the iab are starting in on some related but 
  stuff related to the  impact of compromised communications 
  environments which is a bit different (more than comsec) but does 
  include sec/priv issues so we will be getting back in a bit when
  we've figured that out a bit
- we'll use this slot for chats, except next week (ask Jari when works
  next week) 

- SF action: make git repo, we'll work on some MD on that, I-D not yet
- SF action: schedule an IAB room side meeting for this
- SF action: check the privsec "thanks" framing with MT + this group
  and see if MT wants to send that thanks message
- SF action: make sure someone else gets all the actions next time:-)
